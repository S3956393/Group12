					<h2>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h2>
					
					 <img src="clipart1648497.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="blockchain" />
						<center> (Blockchain Application, 2022) </center>
						<br> <br> <p> &emsp; Blockchain is a technology that simplifies and secures transactions between parties. 
					Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions in the network, 
					where participants confirm the transactions themselves which means they do not need a third-party intermediary 
					(PwC Governance Insights Center, 2018). Nowadays the best-known and most developed blockchain technology is cryptocurrencies - virtual currency supported by cryptographic systems. 
					There are more than 4000 different cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin has become increasingly popular and currently costs more than $50,000 AUD. 
					The growth and development of blockchain are attributed to the cryptocurrencies boom. 
					The pandemic was another great factor that accelerated blockchain development: previously the majority of blockchain projects were related to the finance sector, 
					and now the area of blockchain expands to art, healthcare, education, supply chains, law and many more (Fallucchi and Gerardi, 2021).  
					As the metaverse is emerging these days, blockchain technology will become more influential, as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will enable purchases and storage in virtual reality. 
					Blockchain can be applied beyond cryptocurrencies and the financial sector: companies can widely use it for optimising business processes. 
					One of the major transformations that can be done now is implementing blockchain within everyday banking to make it cheaper and more secure. 
					Blockchain can even bypass third parties such as banks and brokers. However, this move can significantly impact the revenue of traditional banks as they make money on transaction fees (Likos, 2021). 
					The healthcare industry can start implementing blockchain widely to standardize and secure patients' data. 
					The records can be referenced efficiently by the parties involved in the treatment. 
					Estonia is already using blockchain to store prescription information and handle medical billing (Daley, 2002). 
					There is ongoing public testing of blockchain-based voting that can be implemented very soon to make elections more reliable, cheaper and fair. 
					Non-profit organization Vote Australia has started a campaign to implement blockchain in the election process.  
					Within a few years, the possibilities of blockchain implementation can increase greatly due to the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
					The combination of these technologies will allow businesses and governments to unravel patterns that would not be possible to detect previously. 
					For example, it would be possible to predict natural disasters far in advance and fight famine and crises (Kontzer, 2022). 
					The adoption of Internet of Things devices will be accelerated by blockchain as it will solve one of the major issues in this area: security. 
					Advancing technologies behind chips and sensors make it possible to interact with blockchain ledgers in real-time which will create a marketplace of services between devices (Deloitte Switzerland, 2022). 
					Another great impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies development will be the possibility of smart contracts - protocols that automatically enforce a contract when specific conditions are met. 
					Currently, new blockchain developments are trying to overcome high resource demands. 
					For example, some crypto tokens are trying to use smart contracts to harmonise data storage and file sharing. 
					These projects will be an alternative to centralized file storage solutions that are frequently criticized for a lack of transparency and inability to match the changing needs of consumers. 
					At this stage, these projects have not yet succeeded in creating a working solution (Smart contracts: real-world uses and limitations, 2022). 
					A lot of work has to be done in the upcoming years to create a thorough legal regulation and reduce vulnerabilities in the protocols as the loopholes may cost companies millions of dollars. 
					<br> <br>
					&emsp;There is no doubt that the development of blockchain will impact our lives greatly. 
					The financial system will transform first as major banks are already trying to adopt new technologies to make banking more secure and fast. 
					Cryptocurrencies will eventually become a part of the financial system and more businesses will accept cryptocurrencies in exchange for goods and services. 
					The idea of blockchain is to increase automation, reduce verification, paperwork and exclude third parties (Blockchain technology: How it will affect the job market? 2022). 
					This eventually will lead to some areas of our lives dramatically changing as some jobs will be made redundant. For example, intermediary parties in finance, real estate, travel industry or insurance will be at risk of going extinct. In all these industries blockchain will lead to a reduction in transaction costs and an increase in the security of personal information by replacing a worker with a block of code. Another group of workers might be those who deal with paperwork and verifications, such as us auditors or notaries. The transactions they normally deal with will be secured by the blockchain. With the development of smart contracts, it is possible way fewer lawyers will be needed.  At the same time, many legal and jurisdictional issues will arise from smart contracts which will lead to the development of additional legislation. At the start, the technology will demand even more lawyers and other specialists to ensure blockchain executes the contracts properly. 
					Even though emerging technologies make some jobs unnecessary, the good thing is that they often create even more workplaces. 
					Blockchain specialists will be in great demand along with cyber security analysts, software developers, data scientists and other tech-related professionals. 
					<br> <br>
					&emsp;As I work in the legal industry, blockchain will bring significant changes for me. 
					My daily work involves the verification of documents that can be replaced with blockchain. 
					Thankfully, we are being trained on smart contracts and possible legal issues connected to them. 
					Another big shift in work-life will be blockchain-supported land titles across all the states, which will reduce paperwork and middlemen such as settlement agents. 
					With the help of blockchain development, it will be easy to track and prove a legal change of name which now consumes a lot of time within the property registration process.  
					Apart from work, our lives will be improved and we will encounter less fraud and bureaucracy in various aspects of our lives. 
					As for my family, future developments of blockchain will play an important role in expanding my spouse's accounting business as it will automate transactions, 
					increase their security and reduce errors.  
					In the future, we may discover that life expectancy has increased thanks to the blockchain as there will be fewer errors in medical treatment and it will be conducted more efficiently. 
					The negative side effect of the cryptocurrencies boom is the increased cost of graphic processing units which makes computers and laptops more and more expensive. At this point, cryptocurrencies continue to be highly volatile as they have no intrinsic value so it is quite risky to invest in any of them.  
					It is also important to note that cryptocurrencies mining produces a great amount of electronic waste which negatively impacts the environment. For example, Bitcoin's annual footprint is approximately 28 kilotons which is equal to Netherlands' IT and telecommunication equipment waste (Bogna, 2022). Overall, I believe blockchain technologies will revolutionize myriad areas of our everyday lives for the better. It will eventually form a new foundation of economic and social systems. 
					However, it will take many years until all regulatory issues are solved and all benefits of blockchain can be technically enforced. For those who implement blockchain, it is crucial to foresee and minimize potential damaging effects.
