					<h2>Andrew Waters</h2>
					<p>Andrew Waters: (Student ID s3950569) Born in London, he moved to Australia 33 years ago. and lives on the Illawarra coast south of Sydney. He became interested in computing when they first came in the form of a personal desktop. IBM DOS was the first system he worked on. Despite its lack of multi-tasking, it still produced great output, albeit slowly by modern standards. Andrew’s interest developed based on using computers to produce things, firstly desktop publishing and later music production. <br> Myer Briggs decided that Andrew was a campaigner and a true free spirit, outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. Traits include a lively, upbeat approach to life, someone who stands out in any crowd. Apparently, these personality types run deep as does their longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people. Andrew’s learning style is auditory. This means he understands and remember all that is heard. In the Big 5 factors analysis, Andrew scored low on all areas so did not provide anything significant or incisive in terms of his personality.</p>
					<h2>Polina Klishina</h2>
					<p>Polina Klishina (Student ID: S3956393) moved to Australia from Russia 3 years ago. She is an overseas qualified lawyer and works as a paralegal in a law firm in Sydney. Polina enjoys hiking, rock climbing and art. Her interest in IT started a few years ago after trying some Codecademy courses. Polina is interested in front end and UX design and she does not have any prior experience in IT. <br> According to Polina's Myers Briggs test results, she is a Turbulent Logician (INTP-T) and analyst. This type represents a socially selective, rational person who is driven by self-improvement. Logicians tend to get tired out by extensive socializing, they prefer exchanging ideas instead. They are strong at analysing information and producing creative ideas. Learning styles quiz showed that Polina's learning style is reflector, which means she is cautious and takes her time to collect the information. The recommended study methods for reflectors are paired discussions, demonstrations and feedback from others. Psychometrics Project test revealed that Polina is introverted yet friendly and optimistic, as well as highly organised and diligent. These results show that Polina is good at generating ideas which is important for the group. Being organised and diligent is crucial for meeting deadlines and making sure the task is completed properly. </p>
					<h2>Ryan Bodzioch</h2>
					<p>Ryan Bodzioch (Student Number: S3951227) lives in regional South Australia after residing in Adelaide for the majority of his life. Ryan has worked as an automotive mechanic and embarked on a profession in transport and logistics before a career ending back injury. His passion for IT began through exposure to diagnostics by an old family friend, though Ryan has no real experience in the field. His back injury has provided him the opportunity to start his university qualification in IT. Ryan has a menagerie at home, consisting of 2 dogs, 3 cats and a goat. In his spare time, Ryan enjoys gaming, particularly NES, SNES and N64 games. <br> Using the Myer-Briggs test from 16personalities, Ryan’s result was a Turbulent Mediator (INFP-T) personality. The result from this test shows he is an empathetic person in touch with his emotions. It confirms that he is an active listener and enjoys harmonious relationships with others. Being introverted can be challenging when beginning to work in a group situation as he can feel anxious when stepping outside his comfort zone. The second test Ryan participated in was his learning style through Matrix Education. This test identified Ryan as a physical learner who will find online learning a challenge. The final test Ryan completed was the Big Five Personality Test using Truity. This test indicated Ryan is creative, adventurous, and intellectual, whilst also empathetic toward others. The test revealed he can exercise self-discipline but will also engage in instant gratification at times. This test reaffirmed his introverted tendencies and identified he has a mid-range level of neuroticism. In a group setting, Ryan will be empathetic to everyone’s ideas and will generally be agreeable. He will view their perspectives with ease. Ryan’s challenge in these circumstances, however, is to find the confidence to speak out and have his voice heard as this is stepping outside of his comfort zone. </p>
					<h2>Silas Greatorix</h2>
					<p>Silas Greatorix (Student Number: s3955553) is 18 years old and has recently enrolled into the Introduction to programming and the Introduction to Information Technology courses at RMIT University. He currently lives in Murwillumbah, NSW with his family. Having never participated in any form of programming or IT courses, Silas expects the next 11 weeks to be a challenge and a fantastic kickstart to the world of IT. Silas first became interested in 2011, when he was given a Wii as a present. Previous to 2011 his only experience with IT was the use of PowerPoint and Word. And whilst he wouldn’t know what he would do without these applications now, they were excruciatingly boring to him as a child. In his spare time Silas enjoys: gaming, specifically RTS games, learning other languages and listening to podcasts. <br> Silas’ personality results from the Myers-Briggs test show that he is an Advocate (INFJ-T) personality type. An Advocate personality type is quite introverted and tends to look at life with an open and imaginative mind. Advocates are not content floating their way through life and often strive to do the best they can in whatever it is that they are doing. For an advocate type person, success comes from helping those round them and living a fulfilling life. Silas’ personality results obtained from The VARK questionnaire, show that his learning style is Multimodal, this means that he has multiple learning styles his top learning styles being: Visual and kinesthetic meaning he learns best when he is reading or writing notes and taking part of an activity that affirms what he is reading or hearing about. Silas’ personality test results from The Big Five personality test conflict with his results from the Myers-Briggs Test, stating that I am an extroverted, open, conscientious, neurotic, and agreeable person. Taking each of these results into consideration, it is safe to say that Silas would struggle in a group setting not because of a lack of effort but a fear of communicating with his group mates. Silas would work best in a group of people who are extraverted people who he can communicate with without feeling anxious.</p>
					<h2>Tereza Gordon</h2>
					<p>Tereza Gordon (s3985235) is a 19-year-old student based in Melbourne. She has some experience in Python and Java, as well as some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. Tereza has an interest in computer graphics, especially in films, and software engineering. In her free time like to read comic books in her free time, draw and write some simple programs in Python. Her interest in IT first began in primary school during her Robotics class where she programmed Lego Mindstorms and created games using Scratch. <br> On the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator test, Tereza was typed as an INTJ-A with the role of an analyst and confident individualism as the strategy. Most of the results were close to being evenly split between the scales, with the exception of the Introversion/Extroversion scale which heavily skewed towards introversion, so this means that there is a balance. Tereza received a multimodal learning preference result from the VARK Questionnaire with scores that are as follows: 10 for visual, 5 for aural, 8 for read/write and 8 for kinaesthetic. The scores are quite similar for each of the learning styles which shows that she learns in a variety of ways and not just one method for everything. On the Big 5 personality test Tereza had a high agreeability and openness scores, which shows that Tereza is very open to hearing the thoughts of others and doing what they would like to do. In relation to the low score for the neuroticism trait, this would mean that if something goes wrong, she is quite resilient and can bounce back quite quickly.</p>

					<h1>IT Work</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Interviewer: Andrew Waters </p>
					<p>IT Professional: Sid Chen  </p>
					<p>Date: April 12th, 2022 </p>
					<p>Workplace: International Training College, Darling Harbour </p>
					<br>
					<p>What kind of work do you perform? <br> Since the lockdowns I have been the only person charged with maintaining the network at the college. I do everything, from making network cables to looking after the server and upgrading software where required. The equipment we have is all ten years old and sometimes more so there is always something to do.  </p>
					<br>
					<p>Who do you interact with in the workplace? <br> I take my instructions from the owner. He tells me what he wants, and I do it. I discuss with the managers the issues they might be having and even teaching staff sometimes as I fix their problems too!   	</p>
					<br>
					<p>Where do you spend most of your time at work? <br> We have a storage space where we keep bits of equipment, you could say it is a cupboard. I sit in there quite a bit, it has a small desk where I can repair things, a workshop I suppose.  </p>
					<br>
					<p>What aspect of the position is most challenging? <br> I think constantly having to investigate what is causing the issue in the pipeline. What we really need is a complete upgrade! I’ve heard that might happen.  </p>
					<br>
					<p>What system do you maintain? <br> Microsoft Exchange and server software. An old version. It still works OK. I think it is 2008. Although the mail still exists no one uses it anymore! Backing up the network drives is my most important task as it is not automated. Office works pretty well across all the PC’s. </p>
					<br>
					<p>What will the future bring? <br> There are plans afoot for a major upgrade in classroom technology with cameras and tablets to facilitate hybrid learning programmes so it should be an exciting road ahead! </p>

					<h2>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h2>
					
					 <img src="clipart1648497.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="blockchain" />
					<center> <p>(Blockchain Application, 2022)</p> </center>
						<br> <br> <p> &emsp; Blockchain is a technology that simplifies and secures transactions between parties. 
					Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions in the network, 
					where participants confirm the transactions themselves which means they do not need a third-party intermediary 
					(PwC Governance Insights Center, 2018). Nowadays the best-known and most developed blockchain technology is cryptocurrencies - virtual currency supported by cryptographic systems. 
					There are more than 4000 different cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin has become increasingly popular and currently costs more than $50,000 AUD. 
					The growth and development of blockchain are attributed to the cryptocurrencies boom. 
					The pandemic was another great factor that accelerated blockchain development: previously the majority of blockchain projects were related to the finance sector, 
					and now the area of blockchain expands to art, healthcare, education, supply chains, law and many more (Fallucchi and Gerardi, 2021).  
					As the metaverse is emerging these days, blockchain technology will become more influential, as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will enable purchases and storage in virtual reality. 
					Blockchain can be applied beyond cryptocurrencies and the financial sector: companies can widely use it for optimising business processes. 
					One of the major transformations that can be done now is implementing blockchain within everyday banking to make it cheaper and more secure. 
					Blockchain can even bypass third parties such as banks and brokers. However, this move can significantly impact the revenue of traditional banks as they make money on transaction fees (Likos, 2021). 
					The healthcare industry can start implementing blockchain widely to standardize and secure patients' data. 
					The records can be referenced efficiently by the parties involved in the treatment. 
					Estonia is already using blockchain to store prescription information and handle medical billing (Daley, 2002). 
					There is ongoing public testing of blockchain-based voting that can be implemented very soon to make elections more reliable, cheaper and fair. 
					Non-profit organization Vote Australia has started a campaign to implement blockchain in the election process.  
					Within a few years, the possibilities of blockchain implementation can increase greatly due to the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
					The combination of these technologies will allow businesses and governments to unravel patterns that would not be possible to detect previously. 
					For example, it would be possible to predict natural disasters far in advance and fight famine and crises (Kontzer, 2022). 
					The adoption of Internet of Things devices will be accelerated by blockchain as it will solve one of the major issues in this area: security. 
					Advancing technologies behind chips and sensors make it possible to interact with blockchain ledgers in real-time which will create a marketplace of services between devices (Deloitte Switzerland, 2022). 
					Another great impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies development will be the possibility of smart contracts - protocols that automatically enforce a contract when specific conditions are met. 
					Currently, new blockchain developments are trying to overcome high resource demands. 
					For example, some crypto tokens are trying to use smart contracts to harmonise data storage and file sharing. 
					These projects will be an alternative to centralized file storage solutions that are frequently criticized for a lack of transparency and inability to match the changing needs of consumers. 
					At this stage, these projects have not yet succeeded in creating a working solution (Smart contracts: real-world uses and limitations, 2022). 
					A lot of work has to be done in the upcoming years to create a thorough legal regulation and reduce vulnerabilities in the protocols as the loopholes may cost companies millions of dollars. 
					<br> <br>
					&emsp;There is no doubt that the development of blockchain will impact our lives greatly. 
					The financial system will transform first as major banks are already trying to adopt new technologies to make banking more secure and fast. 
					Cryptocurrencies will eventually become a part of the financial system and more businesses will accept cryptocurrencies in exchange for goods and services. 
					The idea of blockchain is to increase automation, reduce verification, paperwork and exclude third parties (Blockchain technology: How it will affect the job market? 2022). 
					This eventually will lead to some areas of our lives dramatically changing as some jobs will be made redundant. For example, intermediary parties in finance, real estate, travel industry or insurance will be at risk of going extinct. In all these industries blockchain will lead to a reduction in transaction costs and an increase in the security of personal information by replacing a worker with a block of code. Another group of workers might be those who deal with paperwork and verifications, such as us auditors or notaries. The transactions they normally deal with will be secured by the blockchain. With the development of smart contracts, it is possible way fewer lawyers will be needed.  At the same time, many legal and jurisdictional issues will arise from smart contracts which will lead to the development of additional legislation. At the start, the technology will demand even more lawyers and other specialists to ensure blockchain executes the contracts properly. 
					Even though emerging technologies make some jobs unnecessary, the good thing is that they often create even more workplaces. 
					Blockchain specialists will be in great demand along with cyber security analysts, software developers, data scientists and other tech-related professionals. 
					<br> <br>
					&emsp;As I work in the legal industry, blockchain will bring significant changes for me. 
					My daily work involves the verification of documents that can be replaced with blockchain. 
					Thankfully, we are being trained on smart contracts and possible legal issues connected to them. 
					Another big shift in work-life will be blockchain-supported land titles across all the states, which will reduce paperwork and middlemen such as settlement agents. 
					With the help of blockchain development, it will be easy to track and prove a legal change of name which now consumes a lot of time within the property registration process.  
					Apart from work, our lives will be improved and we will encounter less fraud and bureaucracy in various aspects of our lives. 
					As for my family, future developments of blockchain will play an important role in expanding my spouse's accounting business as it will automate transactions, 
					increase their security and reduce errors.  
					In the future, we may discover that life expectancy has increased thanks to the blockchain as there will be fewer errors in medical treatment and it will be conducted more efficiently. 
					The negative side effect of the cryptocurrencies boom is the increased cost of graphic processing units which makes computers and laptops more and more expensive. At this point, cryptocurrencies continue to be highly volatile as they have no intrinsic value so it is quite risky to invest in any of them.  
					It is also important to note that cryptocurrencies mining produces a great amount of electronic waste which negatively impacts the environment. For example, Bitcoin's annual footprint is approximately 28 kilotons which is equal to Netherlands' IT and telecommunication equipment waste (Bogna, 2022). Overall, I believe blockchain technologies will revolutionize myriad areas of our everyday lives for the better. It will eventually form a new foundation of economic and social systems. 
					However, it will take many years until all regulatory issues are solved and all benefits of blockchain can be technically enforced. For those who implement blockchain, it is crucial to foresee and minimize potential damaging effects.

					<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
					
					<img src="cybersecurity.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="CyberSecurity" />
					<center> <p>(Figure 2: Cybersecurity Infosec by JuSun, 2019)</p> </center>
					<br>
					
					<p>
					&emsp;Cybersecurity is the act of protecting devices, software, systems, networks, and data from malicious threats (Kaspersky 2022). There are multiple types of online threats that cybersecurity technologies prevent. Malware, one of the most common cyber threats a cybercriminal uses. It will disrupt or damage a user’s device. Malware come in different forms such as viruses (spreads through a user’s device infecting files with problematic code), trojans (tricking users to download software that look legitimate but causes damage and/or collects information), spyware (programs that discreetly record what users do on their devices and capture personal information), ransomware (malware that freezes files and data to threaten a user to give them money), adware (advertisement software to distribute malware), and botnets (a network of devices infected with malware so cybercriminals can perform tasks without the users consent) (Kaspersky 2022). SQL (structured language query) injection is a cyber-attack that takes control and steals sensitive information from databases using code by a malicious SQL declaration (Kaspersky 2022). Phishing is used to get sensitive information from people by getting vulnerable users to click on emails that seem genuine (Kaspersky 2022). A Man in the Middle cyber-attack is when a cybercriminal intercepts communication between two people and steals valuable information or sends misinforming data to one another (Kaspersky 2022). A Denial-of-Service arrack is when a cybercriminal overloads a user’s or companies’ network and/or servers to stop important information to be processed (Kaspersky 2022). There are many innovative technologies being used in the fight against cybercriminals which are helping business and personal, devices and networks become safer from cyber-attacks. 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;Context-Aware Behavioural Analytics is a new way to combat cybersecurity threats. It uses Bioprinting and Behavioural Profiles to learn and remember how users use their devices (CyberDegrees 2021). It monitors behavioural changes and if a hacker can take over their device the technology will see that it is someone else using it and either alert the user or will lock the cybercriminal out. It also uses Mobile Location Tracking to see if someone is logging into another’s accounts that are not familiar to the user’s location and will alert the owner of the accounts there has been a breach. Context-Aware Behavioural Analytics was created to reduce company networks being overrun with meaningless security notifications (CyberDegrees 2021).  
						<br><br>
					&emsp;Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN) is to prevent man in the middle cybercriminals monitoring, altering or injecting messages into a communication channel (CyberDegrees 2021). It does this by breaking up important messages into many parts between the two channels, encrypting it then spreading it across multiple pathways such as servers, computers and mobile devices thus preventing hackers finding the information they want (CyberDegrees 2021). The reason for this is many cybercriminals have become more advanced have been able to crack past codes, therefore protection requires more complex defences (CyberDegrees 2021). 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;Smart Grid Technologies are susceptible to attacks from hackers and DOE National Laboratories have been working on ways to prevent hackers getting in the electrical grid system (CyberDegrees 2021). They use Padlock which encrypts communication between central stations and field devices. It can also monitor for physical attacks and digital attacks of the smart meters (CyberDegrees 2021). DOE National Laboratories uses Watchdog which monitors local area networks to watch known and allowed communications (CyberDegrees 2021). They use Secure Information Exchange Gateways (SIEGate) which creates a secure network in transmission systems to prevent hackers from getting in (CyberDegrees 2021). NetApt is a software tool that allows electrical companies to see their communication paths on a map and can assess any vulnerabilities in minutes (CyberDegrees 2021). As the world becomes more online this will protect smart power, gas and water meters which are becoming increasingly popular. These smart grid technologies will reduce the amount of field workers required to check meters by sending the data straight to the electrical, gas and water companies and only use the field workers for maintenance. This will in turn save costs to the company. Even though this is reducing employment for the field workers it will create more jobs to protect, secure and monitor the smart grid network. 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;Cloud based applications and Bring Your Own Devices (BYODs) are harder to protect because they don’t have firewalls or use traditional cybersecurity technologies (CyberDegrees 2021). Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) has been combined with encryption and intrusion technologies, such as SSO (single sign on), to be able to combat cybercriminal attacks (Ohlhorst 2014). Cloud applications and BYODs are now able to be protected and make it harder for cybercriminals to access these platforms.  
						<br><br>
					&emsp;To resolve the issue of having to remember multiple complicated passwords, Intel has incorporated Intel Authentic technology into their sixth generation Core chips with vPro (Hachman 2016). Intel Authentic is built into the silicone of the chip to allow users to simplify the way they use passwords and pins for devices and accounts (Hachman 2016). Using 2 to 4 methods of authentication such as a pin, a Bluetooth device, a fingerprint and/or location-based identification users can access all their accounts (Hachman 2016). For example, to log onto your computer, without Intel Authentication, you would need to type in a password then if the user wanted to log into emails, banking accounts etc, they would need another complicated password for each account to be protected from cyber-attacks. Instead with Intel Authentication, the user would input a pin and use a Bluetooth device such as a mobile phone or a pin and scan their fingerprint and then have access to every single account on the device from the get-go without having to remember complicated passwords (Hachman 2016). This technology has only been available for businesses and schools but would be an advantage for personal use in the future so users in a private environment will not need to remember multiple complicated passwords to keep them safe from cyber-attacks. 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;In everyday life in a world that is becoming increasingly IT based, society needs protection from malicious threats via cyber-attacks. Most of the population use Antivirus software for all their devices to keep their credentials safe whilst browsing the web, buying items off the internet, and downloading the new song that everyone must have. Some of the recent technologies coming with antivirus software are making it progressively harder for hackers, who are getting more aggressive. Since the Covid outbreak, hackers have increased their efforts in obtaining credentials. Next Generation Antivirus (NGAV) uses a mixture of AI, behavioural recognition, machine learning processes and exploit mitigation to prevent known and unknown cyber-attacks (Crowdstrike 2021). The old Legacy software for Antivirus, for businesses and personal use, is outdated and can only recognise known threats (Crowdstrike 2021). It is not able to protect users from newer threats that attackers are using. Legacy antivirus software was only able to detect 57% of cyber-attacks in 2019 (Crowdstrike 2021). NGAV can learn and detect new threats using Artificial Intelligence, behavioural recognition, and machine learning to work out what new threats are out there and protect businesses and individuals from cyber-attacks. 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;In conclusion, cybersecurity technologies prevent cybercriminals from accessing or damaging our personal and/or confidential information within both our working and private lives. We need cybersecurity to find and develop new ways to combat the rise of cybercriminals who are getting smarter and more aggressive. New technologies can reduce and/or make redundant current jobs in cybersecurity, by reducing the amount that needs to be monitored and updated. However, in turn, they also generate new jobs for creating, developing, and debugging modern technologies within the field of cybersecurity to keep us all safe from cybercriminals.

					<h2>Robots</h2>
					
					<img src="" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Robots" />

					<br>

					&emsp;Robots are automatically operated machines that can complete tasks autonomously and in a human like manner. Robots are being developed purely to make human lives easier and less dangerous by replacing hazardous jobs and completing simple tasks such as making a cup of coffee in the morning. 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;Robots are often equipped with the equivalent human senses of touch, sight, the ability to sense changes in temperature and in more advanced cases have the ability to make decisions. Robots are capable of these actions/abilities because of artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence is a collection of hundreds of different technologies working together to enable machines to sense, understand, act and learn from experience to reach a human-like level of intelligence. One of the most important technologies in the creating and development of AI is Machine Learning and language processing which are used to further develop a robot’s ability to recall and learn from experiences. AI is often categorized as either Narrow or General, Narrow AI has a sole use and is only able to function when the user has entered an input. This could include weather apps, online map services and robots working on production lines. General AI, however, is designed to mimic the human ability to think creatively and strategically and complete complex tasks automatically without an input or command from a human. Whilst it is easy to find a robot with Narrow AI, there is not yet a robot that can be placed in the General category. Currently robots are used everywhere from in your pocket to your kitchen you will never be too far from a Narrow category robot. These simple robots are designed with the purpose of making the lives of the owner/user easier or more efficient depending on the robots’ type. Currently the most common type of robot is the ‘Cartesian Robot’, a mechanical arm used on production lines with the purpose of creating merchandise or materials. Although these types of robots are 36 years old (having been invented in 1986) they are still cutting edge and are constantly being improved on. As the development of Narrow AI becomes less prominent, the focus from Technology companies has changed to General AI. As it stands today, General AI is relatively primitive, only allowing machines to make decisions based on logic and probability. These outstanding achievements of human ingenuity and design are only brought to fruition by the development of AI. General AI works by combining vast amounts of data and iterative processing to create an intelligent system that can learn from and recognize patterns. This requires many fields of computer science to accomplish, the most important of which is machine learning. Machine learning is an application that lets systems or programs learn automatically and create a better experience for the user without being programmed to do so. The machine learning component of AI is what allows it to learn from and recognize patterns. Machine learning works in tandem with Deep Learning, a process that improves a machine's intelligence purely by processing data. Deep Learning uses artificial neural networks to process information. These artificial networks are the second most critical application to successful AI, Neural Networks are an application that analyses data sets multiple times to find a way to interpret meaning from the data. Neural networks work extremely similar to the networks within a human brain, allowing the machine to take in larger data sets, analyses the data, learn from the data’s patterns and then ask questions about it. 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;It is estimated that by 2030 human like androids may be working alongside humans in office spaces, industrial areas, nursing and agriculture completing tasks considered too dangerous or hazardous for humans, these developments have however, raised ethical concerns over what will happen to the employees currently working in these business areas. The introduction of androids would result in many people losing their jobs. But this will not be the apocalypse the films make it out to be. A substantial portion of the workforce being replaced by androids, that do not in any way contribute to the market by purchasing food, paying rent or other expenditures, could be a drain on a company or the economy. Instead, there will likely be a gradual introduction of androids into the workforce, starting with the most unlikeable or dangerous jobs before moving into areas such as business. The introduction of androids, whilst impressive, will not have too great of an effect on the average person. The robots you may find working alongside you in 5-10 years are extremely expensive and require very expensive teams to work with and maintain. So, it is unlikely that while they are being introduced into society you will have direct access to them. They will at first be most prominent in industry areas before moving into nursing at retirement homes or working in office spaces. Within a couple of years of being introduced it may become more common to find a human-like android in the home, but as to how this would work within the market is still not entirely thought out. 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;With the development of AI focusing almost entirely on androids that can mimic humans that work with us, whether I will see or work with robots depends entirely on what career path I attempt to take. Considering I wish to work in the world of IT I would say it is likely that in my lifetime I will work with or around robots. In my or any person’s daily life they will not be greatly affected by the introduction of robots. As we know machines with Narrow AI have been around for 71 years and within those years, we as a society have become accustomed to each day a new machine being invented or an updated version of an old machine being introduced to the market. Because of this, I don’t expect either myself or anyone I know to be overly shocked when the first humanlike androids enter the workforce. The greatest effect the introduction of robots into society may have on me personally, will be in my ability to trust the human spirit to triumph. In that if we can create our own human-like beings to work alongside us, what can’t we do? What could possibly prevent us from doing anything we as a species could want? These questions can be dangerous and when left to stew in the wrong mind can create negative situations. For instance, many companies have this mindset when it comes to the topic of climate change. But these questions are also what brings us these most outstanding and impressive feats of technology by pushing the human spirit to accomplish all that there is to be accomplished.

					<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

					<p>
					&emsp;Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to teach computers to learn without explicitly programming them. Classical machine learning is dependent on a human being interacting with a computer in order for it to learn and become smarter. The way a machine learning algorithm learns can be categorised into three main sections: a decision process, an error function, and model optimisation. A decision process is when the machine learning algorithm takes input data and makes predictions about the pattern of the data. An error function is the function which assesses the accuracy of the model’s prediction. If there is a known example, or historical data, that is then used to make a comparison. This can also be done with data that is incorrect to make sure the computer learns what is wrong. For example, an algorithm meant to identify images of dogs can be given an image of cats so it would learn the difference between cats and dogs. Model optimisation is when the algorithm makes changes to minimise and reduce the amount of error there is between the model’s prediction and the known examples. The algorithm will continuously repeat this process until a particular threshold of accuracy is met.  
						<br><br>
					&emsp;In today’s world, machine learning is used in speech recognition, online chatbots used in customers service, automated stock trading and recommendation engines. It is also used in self-driving cars to teach them how to drive safely in a variety of different environments and weather conditions, as well as to determine the fastest route to a destination. Machine learning can be used in the medical field to enhance medical imaging so that any conditions and illnesses can diagnosed much better than humans can. This in turn can then allow treatments such as chemotherapy to be applied much more accurately without the risk of damaging any other parts of the body. In the entertainment industry, machine learning can used to apply visual effects to a person or object in real time. An example of this is the character Thanos in the movies Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, who was modelled after the actor Josh Brolin. A series of photos were taken to train the algorithm to render an image which would eliminate the need for animators having to do this manually. 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;Machine learning is currently being used now by companies to develop a variety of things, and one of the most notable being humanoid robots, which are likely to be mass-produced in the future. To train the robots to become more relatable to humans, photos taken by cameras placed in the eyes and audio detected from conversations are processed to understand the response from humans and improve their interactions.  
						<br><br>
					&emsp;Companies such as Hanson Robotics have begun developing a humanoid robot called Grace which works with patients when doctors and nurses are unable to attend to them due to being in isolation and social distancing rules. Hanson Robotics has placed a variety of sensors within Grace to be able to read bio-signs, measure the temperature of patients, as well as interact with patients socially so they don’t feel lonely, among many other things. This is being tested with a variety of patients so that the computer learns to conduct accurate assessments of patients for the doctors and nurses. Another major area where machine learning will be used is in augmented and virtual reality. The collection of photos allows for computers to learn and render more realistic imagery in VR and AR. Much of what is possible today with machine learning is through the research of British-Canadian computer scientist, Geoffrey Hinton, which he conducted at the University of Toronto. Another major contributing factor is the hardware used to build powerful computers has dramatically improved over time which allows for faster computations, which then in turn allows us to progress much faster.

					&emsp;Machine learning and artificial intelligence can be quite disruptive to the workforce in range of difference industries such manual labour, medicine, consultation, and many more as computers are becoming quite smart that they could replace humans in some jobs. Tech start-ups like Kindred AI, are using machine learning to teach machinery to pick up and move objects to replace people working factories so they don’t have to do it. This can create a major issue for the economy as it may result in the loss of jobs across a wide range of industries. On the other hand, some jobs cannot be fully automated and require human interaction and supervision, such as those in agriculture. 
						<br><br>
					&emsp;The boom of machine learning today also creates more jobs in relation to the maintenance of the hardware and software, as well as the creation of it. As machine learning improves, the demand for engineers to create higher quality hardware such as GPUs, sensors and cameras that are faster increases so that computers can capture more data to learn more effectively. If the hardware is faster, then algorithms can compute things much faster and reduce the margin of error between the model’s prediction and the known examples in a shorter amount of time. There will also be a need for people to write the software for the computer, as there will be a wider range of application for machine as it become increasingly integrated into society. As it is becoming more commonplace, there will be more demand for it in education as well as research to further improve our knowledge of it.

					&emsp;Machine learning can be used to mimic other people which creates an ethical issue, because photos, videos or audio can be falsified and due to its accuracy and how realistic it is, it can be difficult to disprove. For members of my family who are unable to or have difficulty in driving, machine learning can be particularly useful in developing safe self-driving cars to assist them to go to any places where they want. This makes it easier so they don’t need to spend money on public transport or rideshare services, or even depending on another friend who might not always be available. Phone apps which use machine learning to detect objects can be very helpful for people I know who have poorer eyesight to be able to know what things say just by capturing them with the camera.

					&emsp;Machine learning can be used in many different ways on social media, with one of the most useful being a sensitive content detector that automatically hides anything that may contain violence. This is particularly helpful because it warns you before the video plays that it contains violent content which can be quite disturbing. Another dangerous aspect of machine learning is that with recommendation system on social media tends to create an echo chamber, where people are more likely to only see things that affirm what they believe. Due to the nature of reinforcement machine learning, which is when the computer learns using trial and error instead of sample data, users will constantly click on what they see, and the program will continue to recommend what it thinks users will like. This means people are less likely to see diverse types of posts revolving a specific topic, meaning conversations between people are less productive and interesting because people have a skewed perspective of reality.

					<p>The group members were agreeable and attended the meetings that were held twice a week. We chose the project idea very quickly, IT technologies topics were allocated and completed early. All parts of the assignment were completed. I think that the quality of the discussion during the group's weekly meetings could have been improved as it could have been more active, and more ideas could have been shared. Surprisingly, because of that our weekly meetings were not very helpful. I have learned that it is challenging to work in a team as the outcome will depend on the individual's input. At the same time group work allows to develop a new perspective on things and collaboration definitely improves the project quality as all members can share their thoughts.</p>
