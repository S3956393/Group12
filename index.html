				<div class="sectionContent">
					<h2>Andrew Waters</h2>
					<p>Andrew Waters: (Student ID s3950569) Born in London, he moved to Australia 33 years ago. and lives on the Illawarra coast south of Sydney. He became interested in computing when they first came in the form of a personal desktop. IBM DOS was the first system he worked on. Despite its lack of multi-tasking, it still produced great output, albeit slowly by modern standards. Andrew’s interest developed based on using computers to produce things, firstly desktop publishing and later music production.<br><br>Myer Briggs decided that Andrew was a campaigner and a true free spirit, outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. Traits include a lively, upbeat approach to life, someone who stands out in any crowd. Apparently, these personality types run deep as does their longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people. Andrew’s learning style is auditory. This means he understands and remember all that is heard. In the Big 5 factors analysis, Andrew scored low on all areas so did not provide anything significant or incisive in terms of his personality.</p>
					<h2>Polina Klishina</h2>
					<p>Polina Klishina (Student ID: S3956393) moved to Australia from Russia 3 years ago. She is an overseas qualified lawyer and works as a paralegal in a law firm in Sydney. Polina enjoys hiking, rock climbing and art. Her interest in IT started a few years ago after trying some Codecademy courses. Polina is interested in front end and UX design and she does not have any prior experience in IT.<br><br>According to Polina's Myers Briggs test results, she is a Turbulent Logician (INTP-T) and analyst. This type represents a socially selective, rational person who is driven by self-improvement. Logicians tend to get tired out by extensive socializing, they prefer exchanging ideas instead. They are strong at analysing information and producing creative ideas. Learning styles quiz showed that Polina's learning style is reflector, which means she is cautious and takes her time to collect the information. The recommended study methods for reflectors are paired discussions, demonstrations and feedback from others. Psychometrics Project test revealed that Polina is introverted yet friendly and optimistic, as well as highly organised and diligent. These results show that Polina is good at generating ideas which is important for the group. Being organised and diligent is crucial for meeting deadlines and making sure the task is completed properly. </p>
					<h2>Ryan Bodzioch</h2>
					<p>Ryan Bodzioch (Student Number: S3951227) lives in regional South Australia after residing in Adelaide for the majority of his life. Ryan has worked as an automotive mechanic and embarked on a profession in transport and logistics before a career ending back injury. His passion for IT began through exposure to diagnostics by an old family friend, though Ryan has no real experience in the field. His back injury has provided him the opportunity to start his university qualification in IT. Ryan has a menagerie at home, consisting of 2 dogs, 3 cats and a goat. In his spare time, Ryan enjoys gaming, particularly NES, SNES and N64 games.<br><br>Using the Myer-Briggs test from 16personalities, Ryan’s result was a Turbulent Mediator (INFP-T) personality. The result from this test shows he is an empathetic person in touch with his emotions. It confirms that he is an active listener and enjoys harmonious relationships with others. Being introverted can be challenging when beginning to work in a group situation as he can feel anxious when stepping outside his comfort zone. The second test Ryan participated in was his learning style through Matrix Education. This test identified Ryan as a physical learner who will find online learning a challenge. The final test Ryan completed was the Big Five Personality Test using Truity. This test indicated Ryan is creative, adventurous, and intellectual, whilst also empathetic toward others. The test revealed he can exercise self-discipline but will also engage in instant gratification at times. This test reaffirmed his introverted tendencies and identified he has a mid-range level of neuroticism. In a group setting, Ryan will be empathetic to everyone’s ideas and will generally be agreeable. He will view their perspectives with ease. Ryan’s challenge in these circumstances, however, is to find the confidence to speak out and have his voice heard as this is stepping outside of his comfort zone. </p>
					<h2>Silas Greatorix</h2>
					<p>Silas Greatorix (Student Number: s3955553) is 18 years old and has recently enrolled into the Introduction to programming and the Introduction to Information Technology courses at RMIT University. He currently lives in Murwillumbah, NSW with his family. Having never participated in any form of programming or IT courses, Silas expects the next 11 weeks to be a challenge and a fantastic kickstart to the world of IT. Silas first became interested in 2011, when he was given a Wii as a present. Previous to 2011 his only experience with IT was the use of PowerPoint and Word. And whilst he wouldn’t know what he would do without these applications now, they were excruciatingly boring to him as a child. In his spare time Silas enjoys: gaming, specifically RTS games, learning other languages and listening to podcasts.<br><br>Silas’ personality results from the Myers-Briggs test show that he is an Advocate (INFJ-T) personality type. An Advocate personality type is quite introverted and tends to look at life with an open and imaginative mind. Advocates are not content floating their way through life and often strive to do the best they can in whatever it is that they are doing. For an advocate type person, success comes from helping those round them and living a fulfilling life. Silas’ personality results obtained from The VARK questionnaire, show that his learning style is Multimodal, this means that he has multiple learning styles his top learning styles being: Visual and kinesthetic meaning he learns best when he is reading or writing notes and taking part of an activity that affirms what he is reading or hearing about. Silas’ personality test results from The Big Five personality test conflict with his results from the Myers-Briggs Test, stating that I am an extroverted, open, conscientious, neurotic, and agreeable person. Taking each of these results into consideration, it is safe to say that Silas would struggle in a group setting not because of a lack of effort but a fear of communicating with his group mates. Silas would work best in a group of people who are extraverted people who he can communicate with without feeling anxious.</p>
					<h2>Tereza Gordon</h2>
					<p>Tereza Gordon (s3985235) is a 19-year-old student based in Melbourne. She has some experience in Python and Java, as well as some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. Tereza has an interest in computer graphics, especially in films, and software engineering. In her free time like to read comic books in her free time, draw and write some simple programs in Python. Her interest in IT first began in primary school during her Robotics class where she programmed Lego Mindstorms and created games using Scratch.<br><br>On the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator test, Tereza was typed as an INTJ-A with the role of an analyst and confident individualism as the strategy. Most of the results were close to being evenly split between the scales, with the exception of the Introversion/Extroversion scale which heavily skewed towards introversion, so this means that there is a balance. Tereza received a multimodal learning preference result from the VARK Questionnaire with scores that are as follows: 10 for visual, 5 for aural, 8 for read/write and 8 for kinaesthetic. The scores are quite similar for each of the learning styles which shows that she learns in a variety of ways and not just one method for everything. On the Big 5 personality test Tereza had a high agreeability and openness scores, which shows that Tereza is very open to hearing the thoughts of others and doing what they would like to do. In relation to the low score for the neuroticism trait, this would mean that if something goes wrong, she is quite resilient and can bounce back quite quickly.</p>

					<h2>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h2>
					
					 <img src="clipart1648497.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="blockchain" />
						<center> (Blockchain Application, 2022) </center>
						<br> <br> <p> &emsp; Blockchain is a technology that simplifies and secures transactions between parties. 
					Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions in the network, 
					where participants confirm the transactions themselves which means they do not need a third-party intermediary 
					(PwC Governance Insights Center, 2018). Nowadays the best-known and most developed blockchain technology is cryptocurrencies - virtual currency supported by cryptographic systems. 
					There are more than 4000 different cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin has become increasingly popular and currently costs more than $50,000 AUD. 
					The growth and development of blockchain are attributed to the cryptocurrencies boom. 
					The pandemic was another great factor that accelerated blockchain development: previously the majority of blockchain projects were related to the finance sector, 
					and now the area of blockchain expands to art, healthcare, education, supply chains, law and many more (Fallucchi and Gerardi, 2021).  
					As the metaverse is emerging these days, blockchain technology will become more influential, as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will enable purchases and storage in virtual reality. 
					Blockchain can be applied beyond cryptocurrencies and the financial sector: companies can widely use it for optimising business processes. 
					One of the major transformations that can be done now is implementing blockchain within everyday banking to make it cheaper and more secure. 
					Blockchain can even bypass third parties such as banks and brokers. However, this move can significantly impact the revenue of traditional banks as they make money on transaction fees (Likos, 2021). 
					The healthcare industry can start implementing blockchain widely to standardize and secure patients' data. 
					The records can be referenced efficiently by the parties involved in the treatment. 
					Estonia is already using blockchain to store prescription information and handle medical billing (Daley, 2002). 
					There is ongoing public testing of blockchain-based voting that can be implemented very soon to make elections more reliable, cheaper and fair. 
					Non-profit organization Vote Australia has started a campaign to implement blockchain in the election process.  
					Within a few years, the possibilities of blockchain implementation can increase greatly due to the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
					The combination of these technologies will allow businesses and governments to unravel patterns that would not be possible to detect previously. 
					For example, it would be possible to predict natural disasters far in advance and fight famine and crises (Kontzer, 2022). 
					The adoption of Internet of Things devices will be accelerated by blockchain as it will solve one of the major issues in this area: security. 
					Advancing technologies behind chips and sensors make it possible to interact with blockchain ledgers in real-time which will create a marketplace of services between devices (Deloitte Switzerland, 2022). 
					Another great impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies development will be the possibility of smart contracts - protocols that automatically enforce a contract when specific conditions are met. 
					Currently, new blockchain developments are trying to overcome high resource demands. 
					For example, some crypto tokens are trying to use smart contracts to harmonise data storage and file sharing. 
					These projects will be an alternative to centralized file storage solutions that are frequently criticized for a lack of transparency and inability to match the changing needs of consumers. 
					At this stage, these projects have not yet succeeded in creating a working solution (Smart contracts: real-world uses and limitations, 2022). 
					A lot of work has to be done in the upcoming years to create a thorough legal regulation and reduce vulnerabilities in the protocols as the loopholes may cost companies millions of dollars. 
					<br> <br>
					&emsp;There is no doubt that the development of blockchain will impact our lives greatly. 
					The financial system will transform first as major banks are already trying to adopt new technologies to make banking more secure and fast. 
					Cryptocurrencies will eventually become a part of the financial system and more businesses will accept cryptocurrencies in exchange for goods and services. 
					The idea of blockchain is to increase automation, reduce verification, paperwork and exclude third parties (Blockchain technology: How it will affect the job market? 2022). 
					This eventually will lead to some areas of our lives dramatically changing as some jobs will be made redundant. For example, intermediary parties in finance, real estate, travel industry or insurance will be at risk of going extinct. In all these industries blockchain will lead to a reduction in transaction costs and an increase in the security of personal information by replacing a worker with a block of code. Another group of workers might be those who deal with paperwork and verifications, such as us auditors or notaries. The transactions they normally deal with will be secured by the blockchain. With the development of smart contracts, it is possible way fewer lawyers will be needed.  At the same time, many legal and jurisdictional issues will arise from smart contracts which will lead to the development of additional legislation. At the start, the technology will demand even more lawyers and other specialists to ensure blockchain executes the contracts properly. 
					Even though emerging technologies make some jobs unnecessary, the good thing is that they often create even more workplaces. 
					Blockchain specialists will be in great demand along with cyber security analysts, software developers, data scientists and other tech-related professionals. 
					<br> <br>
					&emsp;As I work in the legal industry, blockchain will bring significant changes for me. 
					My daily work involves the verification of documents that can be replaced with blockchain. 
					Thankfully, we are being trained on smart contracts and possible legal issues connected to them. 
					Another big shift in work-life will be blockchain-supported land titles across all the states, which will reduce paperwork and middlemen such as settlement agents. 
					With the help of blockchain development, it will be easy to track and prove a legal change of name which now consumes a lot of time within the property registration process.  
					Apart from work, our lives will be improved and we will encounter less fraud and bureaucracy in various aspects of our lives. 
					As for my family, future developments of blockchain will play an important role in expanding my spouse's accounting business as it will automate transactions, 
					increase their security and reduce errors.  
					In the future, we may discover that life expectancy has increased thanks to the blockchain as there will be fewer errors in medical treatment and it will be conducted more efficiently. 
					The negative side effect of the cryptocurrencies boom is the increased cost of graphic processing units which makes computers and laptops more and more expensive. At this point, cryptocurrencies continue to be highly volatile as they have no intrinsic value so it is quite risky to invest in any of them.  
					It is also important to note that cryptocurrencies mining produces a great amount of electronic waste which negatively impacts the environment. For example, Bitcoin's annual footprint is approximately 28 kilotons which is equal to Netherlands' IT and telecommunication equipment waste (Bogna, 2022). Overall, I believe blockchain technologies will revolutionize myriad areas of our everyday lives for the better. It will eventually form a new foundation of economic and social systems. 
					However, it will take many years until all regulatory issues are solved and all benefits of blockchain can be technically enforced. For those who implement blockchain, it is crucial to foresee and minimize potential damaging effects.

					<p>The group members were agreeable and attended the meetings that were held twice a week. We chose the project idea very quickly, IT technologies topics were allocated and completed early. All parts of the assignment were completed. I think that the quality of the discussion during the group's weekly meetings could have been improved as it could have been more active, and more ideas could have been shared. Surprisingly, because of that our weekly meetings were not very helpful. I have learned that it is challenging to work in a team as the outcome will depend on the individual's input. At the same time group work allows to develop a new perspective on things and collaboration definitely improves the project quality as all members can share their thoughts.</p>
